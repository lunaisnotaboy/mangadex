# MangaDex

What a reimplementation of MangaDex using Ruby on Rails could look like.

## DISCLAIMER

MangaDex is owned by [mangadex.org], not me. This was just a fun exercise to sharpen
my skills with Ruby on Rails, and so I could see the MangaDex UI again.

If the owners of [mangadex.org] ask me to take this down, I will.

I can be contacted at <hello@glimmerhq.com> for that purpose.

All assets owned by MangaDex will be listed in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md), as well as other
projects used.
